# Copilot instructions (TexasHoldemNoLimit)

## Language
- Think in English.
- Communicate with the user in **zh-tw** (Traditional Chinese), unless the user explicitly requests another language.

## Project type & tooling
- This is a **Cocos Creator** project; `package.json` is Creator metadata (not npm scripts) and pins `creator.version` to **3.8.7**.
- TypeScript config is **generated by Creator** and extended by `tsconfig.json`:
  - Edit `tsconfig.json` for project-wide TS settings (currently `strict: false`).
  - Do **not** hand-edit `temp/tsconfig.cocos.json` (generated; contains machine-specific absolute paths).

## Repo layout (what to edit)
- Author assets/scripts should live under `assets/` (mapped as `db://assets/*` in `temp/tsconfig.cocos.json`).
  - In this snapshot `assets/` is empty; most content present is generated cache.
- Treat these as **generated** and avoid editing them in PRs unless you’re explicitly regenerating Creator output:
  - `library/` (asset import/cache)
  - `temp/` (TS declarations + packed JS under `temp/programming/...`)
  - `profiles/`, `build/`, `local/`, `native/` (also listed in `.gitignore`)

## Engine / feature configuration
- Engine module selection is configured in `settings/v2/packages/engine.json`.
  - Current config includes 2D + UI + Tween + TiledMap, Physics2D, Spine/DragonBones, Audio/Video/WebView, and `custom-pipeline`.

## Working conventions for changes
- Prefer changes in **Creator-facing sources** (typically `assets/` + `settings/`) rather than generated artifacts.
- If you must touch generated JS, it lives under `temp/programming/packer-driver/...` and is SystemJS-wrapped; regenerate from Creator instead of editing by hand.

## Build / run / debug
- Primary workflow is via the Cocos Creator Editor:
  - Open the project folder in Creator **3.8.7**.
  - Use Editor Preview/Build; runtime output/artifacts are written into `temp/` and `build/`.

## When adding new code
- Create new gameplay code as `.ts` Creator scripts under `assets/` (so Creator generates the needed `.meta` and import records).
- Use engine types from `temp/declarations/*.d.ts` (e.g., `temp/declarations/cc.d.ts`, `temp/declarations/jsb.d.ts`).
